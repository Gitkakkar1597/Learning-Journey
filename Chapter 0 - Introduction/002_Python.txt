According to Stackoverflow, python is the most loved & easiest programming langauge to learn now

Programming: Just like we humans communicate with each other using languages liek English or Hindi, we use programming language like python to communicate with computers
We can't just instruct a machine to do a task in our langauge, we write a program for a task
Just like we speak chinese with a chinese native or french with someoen from France, we have many langauges like C, C++, JavaScriptm etc to communicate/instruct to a machine that it understands

Python as first language ?
1. Simple and easy to understand
2. Pseudocode nature of python : Feels like reading simple English 

Features of python:
1. Easy to understand
2. Development time of applications is lesser. Example : Building a chat assistant program is easier in python
3. Dedicated libararies support like Tensorflow for ML & AI
4. Free and open-source
5. High - level langauge , means we talk in our langauge & it converts that into low-level (machine langauage) instruction which is given to machine

Hardware : Our computer like CPU, GPU, RAM
Software : Instructions
These softwares are excuted inside hardware

The pythonn script is like a software as well and it instructs hardware to perform some tasks

Basically, python interpreter is given the code and it converts that into machine language to computer

6. It's a portable language, means if a certain code is written in Windows OS, macOS or even Linux, the code works everywhere
